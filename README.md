# Python coding challenges for interviews

This project has all the trickiest, baddest and meanest examples I find, in an effort to practice for coding interviews.

For every exercise I always add a test using UnitTest, and because I'm training lambdas I try to answer the challenge using Lambdas, Filter or Maps.

Tools:

- Python 3.8
- UnitTest
